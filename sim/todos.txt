1. Sub-Circuits: Fully implement the abstraction and library feature.
2. Configurable Gates: Allow changing the number of inputs for logic gates.
3. Keyboard Shortcuts: Add Swing Key Bindings for common actions.
4. Orthogonal Wiring: Implement 90-degree wire routing (Manhattan routing).
5. Pin-to-Grid Alignment: Standardize component sizes and pin offsets so pins always land on grid intersections.
6. Text Labels: Allow users to annotate their circuits.
