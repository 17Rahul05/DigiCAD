Medium-Priority Improvements


0. Allow Configurable Gate Inputs:
    * Problem: All gates have a fixed number of inputs
      (e.g., 2-input AND). Users often need gates with 3,
      4, or more inputs.
    * Suggestion:
        * Add a property to LogicGate for numberOfInputs.
        * When a component is selected, show a small
          configuration panel or a right-click context
          menu that allows the user to change this
          property.
        * The gate's drawing and logic in updateState
          would then need to adapt to the variable number
          of inputs.


  2. Orthogonal Wire Routing
  Right now, wires are direct lines. Most professional simulators
  (like Logisim) use orthogonal routing (wires only move in
  90-degree angles).
   * Why: This involves interesting algorithms (like A* search or
     basic Manhattan geometry) to find paths that avoid overlapping
     components.


  3. Sequential Logic & Clocks
  Currently, the simulation is combinational (inputs change, outputs
  update). Adding a Clock component and Flip-Flops (D, JK)
  introduces "Time" and "State."
   * Why: This tests your ability to handle asynchronous events and
     edge-triggered logic, which is significantly more complex than
     simple gate propagation.


  4. Spatial Indexing (Performance)
  If a user places 5,000 gates, looping through every component to
  see which one was clicked (O(N)) becomes slow. Implementing a
  QuadTree for spatial lookups reduces this to O(log N).
   * Why: Demonstrates that you think about scalability and
     algorithmic efficiency.


  5. Unit Testing for Logic Gates
  Create a test suite that programmatically builds circuits (e.g., a
  Full Adder) and asserts that the truth tables are 100% correct.   
   * Why: In interviews, "How do you test this?" is a mandatory     
     question. Having automated tests for your logic engine shows   
     maturity.
